Interactive ChatGPT Python Integration

Welcome to my ChatGPT Python integration project! This program was made with the assistance of Chat GPT.

What Can It Do?

My project lets users interact with ChatGPT in Python. You can ask questions, share files like Word documents, Excel sheets, PDFs, and PowerPoint presentations, and even quiz ChatGPT about the contents of those files.

Data Storage

We've made sure to keep track of your conversations! The program neatly stores all conversation data in an SQL database for easy reference and retrieval.

How to Get Started

Using our project is as simple as pie! Just fire it up, and you're ready to chat with ChatGPT and explore its file-reading capabilities.
